# hatORG

A new solution to window management.

| Window System | Support | User | Looks | Performance | Stability |
|---------------|---------|------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| gX            | 6       | 4    | 7     | 6           | 3         |
| g11           | 8       | 7    | 6     | 8           | 7         |
| g12           | 7       | 8    | 10    | 6           | 8         |
| hatORG        | 8       | 7    | 8     | 9           | 10        |

- **gX**: 26
- **g11**: 36
- **g12**: 39
- **hatORG**: ***42***

On hardware, hatORG performs the same, if NOT BETTER than **g12**.

Instead of using an entire panel for one window, this new generation actually implements a stable Window chrome (unlike **UNSTABLE** windowchrome.. *cough cough gX*)

This was made to be an alternative to the G Window system.
